# RAIL_LOCALIZATION_EXP
My experiments for RAIL lab's localization related functionality.

## Coordinate Frame

> Unit: Measured in meters + rads + seconds

### X-Axis

Looking at the origin from the very back of the robot, the X axis extends through the origin point and runs to the front and back.

The X axis values increase to the front.
### Z-Axis

Looking at the origin from the very back of the robot, the Z axis extends through the origin point and runs up and down in a vertical line.

Increasing Z values extend upwards.
### Y-Axis

Looking at the origin from the very back of the robot, the Y axis extends through the origin point and runs to the right and left.

The Y axis values increase to the left.

### Rotation
Looking at the very tip of the axis from the origin, the + rotation is counter-clockwise.
